                        <p class="sectionContent">Throughout college I pursued business courses while doing computer science projects for fun. In one business of my business courses, I programed the backend and frontend of an application using python and sequel which resulted in my desire to code to grow. Fast forward to today, I am learning on my own making projects to showcase in hopes to get a software engineer job.</p>
                        <p class="sectionContent">The main focus today is creating this personal website and a few personal projects to put on the site. I typically enjoy doing the backend in python more, however, I wanted to challenge myself to learn both aspects of programming.</p>
                        <p class="sectionContent" style="padding-bottom: 30px;">When I am not at my computer programming, you can find me adventuring the outdoors, volunteering at organizations, or relaxing with family and friends.</p>
